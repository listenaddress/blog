    <Title>WIP: BOAT</Title>
    <P>Thinking of building a boat to live on and scoot about various forms of the holy liquid. Iâ€™d love to get started in the next few years but nobody knows yet. <a href="instagram.com/elihulsing" target="_blank">Eli</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Arran_Davis" target="_blank">Arran</a> may join me, and others were tickled and wanted a note when we get started. Idk, it seems like I need to. The river is my favorite place. And itâ€™s never been possible until recently to do work with instant global comms like we've got.</P>
    <P>I started fiending when I was camping on the Mississippi with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr_chrisjack/" target="_blank">Chris</a> one night. When I got up in the middle of the night the fog was thicc but only 10-20 feet high and neatly floating over the rio. The moon was all bright. I could see everything around me. It was beyond clear right there how slept on rivers are and that Iâ€™d love to be able to live on them, cruise around, dock up at new vistas.</P>
    <P>My first thought was something optimized for living and working with lots of windows. Something for 4-10 people at first maybe? For starters I imagined something like this but not such the modern vibe.</P>

    <P>But also wondering about different shapes, curves/underwater windows. Stuff like this.</P>

    <P>On the other hand, Eli is trying to build a navy classic w heavy artillery so we'll see what we end up with.</P>
